        <p>My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!</p>
        <p>I will continue to add content to this site over the next few months; so, please  check back!</p>
        <p>Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Life finds a way. I was part of something special. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!</p>
        <h2>HehYes</h2>
        <p>We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. I was part of something special.</p>
        <p>So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. I was part of something special. You really think you can fly that thing?</p>
        <h2><i>Ehhhhhhpheil</i> What Do</h2>
        <p>We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?</p>
        <p>Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.
        </p>
        <p>Checkmate... Life finds a way. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!</p>
        <p>They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Yes, Yes, without the oops! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.</p>
